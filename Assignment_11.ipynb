    "Answer:\n",
    "spam = int(input())\n",
    "assert spam > 0, \"Spam value is negative intger\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, 'hello' and 'hello' are considered the same, and 'goodbye' and 'GOODbye' are also considered the same).\n",
    "Answer:\n",

    "4. What are the two lines that must be present in your software in order to call logging.debug()?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "import logging\n",

    "    filename='test.log',\n",
    "    level=logging.DEBUG,\n",

    "5. What are the two lines that your program must have in order to have logging.debug() send a logging message to a file named programLog.txt?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(\n",
    "    filename='test.log',\n",

    "6. What are the five levels of logging?\n",
    "Answer: Below are the levels of logging:\n",
    "      logging.INFO\n",
    "      logging.DEBUG\n",
    "      loggging.WARNING\n",
    "      logging.ERROR\n",
    "      logging.CRITICAL\n",
    "      \n",
    "7. What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?\n",
    "Answer: logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n",
    "      \n",
    "8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "Answer: With logging module it is to display and hide messages with simple logging.disable command.\n",
    "      also logging is for programmer to debug code and print is used to display a message to user.\n",
    "      \n",
    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "Answer: Step In- one line execution at a time\n",
    "Step Over - excecute the next line of code, but if it is a program, it will\n",
    "        complete the entire function call.\n",
    "Step out  - execute the lines of code unti it returns from the current function.\n",
    "        (out is useful when you stepped into a function call).\n",
    "      \n",
    "10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "Answer: clicked continue, the debugger will stop when it has reached the end of the program or a line with a breakpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "Answer: A breakpoint can be a specific line of code and which forces the debugger to\n",
    "pause whenever the program execution reaches that line.\n",
